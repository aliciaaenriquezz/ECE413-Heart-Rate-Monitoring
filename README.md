# ECE413 Web Development and IoT: Heart Rate Monitoring Project 
## Project Description
We were tasked with creating a **heart rate monitoring IoT web application**. Our heart rate and blood oxygen saturation level readings have been obtained using a MAX30102 Pulse Detection Blood Oxygen module. Using this module along with a Particle Argon IoT development board, a user is able to obtain their health metrics through an account. This account can be updated as well. This is a low-cost alternative for other various cardiovascular health monitoring equipment. This application can be accessed at: http://ec2-18-220-166-219.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/ on desktop and mobile devices. Our project files can be accessed here in this GitHub.
